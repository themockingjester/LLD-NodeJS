# About The Flow

this is just a dummy system which just shows how can we create a elevator system by following the concepts of lld.

1. Algorithms used here are just for fun.
2. This system can be extended to create a full fledged system in future.
3. By default system uses two elevator in demo but you can use more if needed.
